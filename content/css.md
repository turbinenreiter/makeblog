## CSS is crazy and weird

That's no big news, I guess. I just wonder how professionals handle that. I used 
Google's Material Design Color Paulette on this. I think it's nice and it's way easier 
to use that than to chose colors myself. There are so many! I'm also using the Roboto font and the overall style. Like the header. The fixed header, which doesn't flow with the rest of the page, so the actual content would be covered by it. Applying some 
margin to the top of the following content solves that - except when you have other 
screen sizes and it suddenly doesn't anymore. Sigh.

Next up - pagination.
