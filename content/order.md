## Finally ordered by Date!

So, this page is generated by a little script I'm writing, called *makeblog*. 
There are a lot of good blog programs out there, so obviously I decided to write 
my own.
####It works somewhat like this:
* there is a template folder, holding a .html and .css template
* there is content folder, holding .md files that make up the content
* makeblog takes the content, injects it into the template and deploys it

The .md files starts with a meta section, where date, author and tags are defined. 
Using BeautifulSoup, the .html template is opened, and the articles are added. The 
date and time meta-data is used to bring the articles in reverse chronological order - 
which happened to be quite hard to do. I assigned IDs to the articles that hold the 
date and time, in the form of 'd%d%m%y%H%M', and use this ID to find the article before 
which a new, younger article is supposed to be placed. This is done using find_all() 
and that's where it got messy. find_all() doesn't find all. In the end, it was the 
parsers fault, neither default nor lxml worked, after I switched to html5lib - it 
suddenly found all IDs I needed.

Next up is some work on the .css and then I want to make the tags useful.
